## Φ Ψ λ ϐ ҩ Ӝ ⊙ ⚧ ⚭ Ω

We're building the tools to help our community make friends, tell stories, share art and create lore.

You'll find the open source code that powers:

- The [Forgotten Runes website](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/) and Book of Lore
- Our smart contracts and subgraph
- The Runiverse API (Coming Soon!)

## Resources
You'll also find resources and references for building projects of your own!

Want to see what others have built or share something of your own? Checkout [awesome-forgotten-runes](repo-url).

## Contributing

If you're a member of the cult and want to contribute to this code or build something for Forgotten Runes, hop into [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/forgottenrunes) and let the Coding Guild and/or the Core team know.

That said, just because you could countribute code doesn't mean you need to or even should. Many of us spend a lot of time coding for work already and Forgotten Runes exist to help you rediscover what was forgotten within yourself.

What matters is that you create in earnest in whatever way is most meaningful to you.
